* Testable Components
* What is SFC?
  * An HTML like file with `.vue` extension
  * One file per component
  * Stlye in the same file
  * Uses just HTML, CSS, and JS
* Browsers donâ€™t under SFC
  * We compile/convert SFC to JavaScript
* JSX
  * Extends JavaScript
  * Inherently Flexible
  * Empowers the end user
* Templates
  * Extends HTML
  * Inherently declarative
  * Empowers build tools
  * Interpolation or Directives
  * Template -> parse(template) -> Abstract Syntax Tree -> codegen(AST) -> Render Function
* Summary
