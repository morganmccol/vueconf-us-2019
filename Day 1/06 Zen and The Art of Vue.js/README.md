Examine a theory of creating quality products by positioning ourselves in a mental model contrasting the logical and the artistic
Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance inspired this presentation
- A book about a road trip on a motorcycle
- An analysis of a half-forgotten past existence as a writing professor obsessed with 'good' writing
  - a comparison of the world experience of a logical, analytical author with travelling companions who are more artistic
- that's all the motorcycle is, a system of concepts worked out in steel
- If you were to show an engine to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of interest in it.

What is a javascript framework
- a system of concepts worked out in code (logical view)
- a system that makes working with JS more elegant, easier, less error prone (artistic/romantic view)

Quality
- finding fulcrum between hip and square, romantic and classic, and tech vs humanistic
- How?
  - at the moment of pure quality, subject and object are identical
    - flow (book)
    - similar to zen, just sitting
    - not being dominated by feelings
    - bridging the divide between developer and designer: Sarah Drasner is an example of briding UX and Development
- What is the Zen of Vue
  - Design and Technology sweet spot to create a really quality experience
  - Docs are good
    - Chris Fritz quote: guide, become more content, relationships between developers and their work using VUe
- Mandala me
  - Mandalas represent the cosmos and creating one is an act of meditation on the attainment of enlightenment by the visualizing of pure lands (perfect world)
  - Use the new Vue CLI 3 plugin for NativeScript-Vue
    - allows you to create a code shared web and mobile shared project
  - Forked templates (template for web and for native [mobile])
- Firebase x2, Vuex (both work nicely)
- Code sharing as convergence
  - find you flow as a developer y building simultaneously for web, iOs, and Android
    - focus on UX
    - The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of the mountain or the pedal of a flower
