* Examine a theory of creating quality products by positions ourselves in a mental model contrasting the logical and artistic
* Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance
  * A book about a road trip on a motorcycle
  * Analysis of past existence as a writing professor obsessed with ‘good’ writing
  * Comparison of world experience of a logical, analytical author traveling with companions who art ‘artistic’
  * Exploration in what quality is
* Classicist’s point of view
  * “A motorcycle can be divided according to its components and according to its functions”
  * The “what” of the motorcycle: components
  * The “how” of the motorcycle: functions
  * That’s all the motorcycle is: a system of concepts worked out in steel
  * Proceeds by reason and by laws
* Romantic’s point of view
  * “If you were to show me an engine to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much o interest in it. It has no appeal because the reality he sees is its surface.”
  * A romantic viewport values the experience of motorcycling more than the machine itself
  * Inspirational, imaginative, creative, feelings
* What is a javascript framework:
  * Classicist: A system of concepts worked out in code
  * Romantic: A system that makes working with JS more elegant, easier, less error-prone
* The classic and romantic split is between two separate worlds
  * The quest: a convergence of the classic and the romantic world views
* **Quality: the fulcrum between hip and square, romantic and classic, technological and humanistic**
  * How can we achieve quality?
  * At the moment of pure quality, subject and object are identical
  * Similar to Buddhism’s concept of “just sitting”
* Bridging the divide between developer and designer
  * Art, design, code, craft of quality, user experience
* The Zen of Vue
  * Design and Technology
  * Docs
    * Everyone loves the vue docs
    * “I try to remember that the docs aren’t an objective artifact describing the reality of Vue - its goal isn’t even directly to teach people how to use Vue, but rather to guide their emotional and conceptual development in a way that helps them become more content in their work.”
    * Relationships between developers and their work
  * What if you could create a project that would find flow between three platforms without struggle
  * And that project would help you create a contemplative work of art to aid in your focus
* Demo: Mandala Me
  * Mandalas represent the cosmos and creating one is an act of meditation on the attainment
  * Create your own sacred geometry
  * **Use the new Vue CLI 3 plugin for nativescript-vue**
    * On the web `main.js`, for mobile `main.native.js`
    * Forked templates using template web and template native
    * Forked components - HelloWorld for native or iOS/Android versioning
    * Share styles cross-platform or scope them
  * Firebase x2, Vuex, new drawing plugin, side drawer, Vuetify on web
  * Create modules to manage different Firebase versions
* Find your flow as a developer by building simultaneously for web, iOS, and Android
* Focus on user experience by providing native apps appropriate to each platform
