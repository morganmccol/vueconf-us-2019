## The Future of Web Animation

- Prinicpal Lead Engineer at Microsoft
- Web is for communicating
  - think about animation as a kid that made you feel happy, sad, fearful, curious
  - emotions are attached to our limbic system and makes it easier to recall
  - cartoons give color and shape and bring life to our internal worlds
- Hooks
  - reusing pieces of animation across our application
  - hooks moving over to composition components, so syntax is changing, but concept is the same
  - "Dinner's on me" food app
  - Why aren't we just using mixins?
    - hooks allow us to pass state from one another and can't do this mixins, components are aware of each other
    - they make it explicit where logic is coming from
    - CSS-Tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue
- Page transitions
  - Cognitive load needs to be reduced for the user
  - Jira's new layout uses animation to show how to remap grouped components
  - going to use Nuxt to show how to do this
    - recall: Nuxt is good for static pages
  - `<Transition-Group />`
    - Flip under the hood to prevent repainting to make it performant (first last invert play)
    - pain to implement but this is abstracted away by vue
  - page-transitions.com
- Responsive Web Design
  - Flexbox, media queries
- Make 3D animations on the web
  - what if browser's had a spec to do this
  - what's not important is how to do this right now, but focus on the what ifs on what we could do in the near future
  - chrome dev tools has features support VR primitives to make 3d experiences
    - made only with HTML elements
- Augmented VR (ARKIT 2.0)
  - what if this was available to us in the browser
  - AR Chemistry
    - this is easier to recall with animation than reading from a textbook
    - reduces cognitive load to nothing
  - what if you were trying to learn the piano and had AR to help you learn it like guitar hero mapping notes to that style
  - Static 2D is an abstraction of 3D
    - using motion and 3D is a lot more intuitive
- voice controlled experiences on the web
  - hands free
  - machine learning cognitive services to try out that connects a vue application to luis (language understanding)
  - map words to emotions and animations
  - [GitHub - sdras/three-vue-pattern: A biofeedback visualization made with Three.js, Vue, and LUIS (cognitive services)](https://github.com/sdras/three-vue-pattern)
- why are we in a rut
  - why do we make the same site over and over
  - why do we feel nothing and no emotions tied to it
  - why do we still use table like layouts when we can do so much more
- time to expand our minds beyond the rectangles of the past
  - think bigger on the things you're going to build next
  - how to create something that doesn't already exist
